### Code Splitting

Code splitting is a technique of splitting production JavaScript into smaller files, thus allowing the application to be only partially downloaded. Any unused code will not be downloaded until it is required by the application.

Most of the time code splitting should be done on the routes level, but can also be used for other lazy loaded parts of application.

Do not code split everything as it might even worsen your application's performance.

### Component and state optimizations

- Do not put everything in a single state. That might trigger unnecessary re-renders. Instead split the global state into multiple stores according to where it is being used.

- Keep the state as close as possible to where it is being used. This will prevent re-rendering components that do not depend on the updated state.
